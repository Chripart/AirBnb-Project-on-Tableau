# AirBnb-Project-on-Tableau
In this excersice, I created a Dashboard in Tableau for AirBnb listings with insights on price points per zipcode and bedrooms in Seattle.


Explore Airbnb insights with this Tableau dashboard featuring:

1. Zipcode Price Barplot: Compare Average prices across zipcodes through a color-coded plot.
2. Zipcode Price Map: Visualize pricing trends on the city map, with zipcodes colored and information on average prices
3. Revenue trend: Pinpoint the most profitable times for AirBnb listings with a graph illustrating revenue througout the year.
4. Average Price per Bedroom: Assess pricing variations based on the number of bedrooms.
5. Competitive landscape by Bedrooms: Analyze the AirBnB market's competition by exploring the distribution of listings based on the number of bedrooms.
